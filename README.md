## This is the repository of Cody Querubin. This will explain what each component achieves for this project.
For starters, this code utilizes ReactJS. To run this locally, run the command: npm start (you may need to npm install react-scripts)

## public
This folder contains all of the img files.

## src
The source codes of this portfolio. This also contains separate directories, such as experiences, projects, and welcome, which are the different tabs of the portfolio.

index.js is used to export the 'root' id to be displayed in the index.html. App.js is used to build the container (as well as displaying the contact information), and menu.js is used to generate the layout (this utilizes the FramerJS library).
